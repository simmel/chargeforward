=============

Quickly create a VM to use as a SOCKS proxy on Digital Ocean for all sorts of..
legal.. reasons..

TODO/FIXME
----------
* If the image doesn't exist in the current region, (offer to?) relocate it.
* Check so that ssh actually starts to listen on the port and *then* say we're done.
* Rewrite some loops as functions so they can be reused.
